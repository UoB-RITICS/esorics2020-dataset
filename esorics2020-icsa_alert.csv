ICSA-10-238-01B,https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/ICSA-10-238-01B,2010-09-15,2014-01-08,Stuxnet Malware Mitigation (Update B),1,Siemens," In July, ICS-CERT published an advisory and a series of updates regarding the Stuxnet malware entitled “ICSA-10-201 USB Malware Targeting Siemens Control Software.” Since then, ICS-CERT has continued analysis of the Stuxnet malware in an effort to determine more about its capabilities and intent. As the analysis has progressed, understanding of the malware sophistication has continued to increase. Stuxnet makes use of a previously unpatched Windows vulnerability and a digitally signed kernel-mode rootkit. There have been two digital certificates used to sign this rootkit. The original certificate was revoked. Subsequently, a second variant was discovered in which the same rootkit was signed with a different key, which has also been revoked. With approximately 4,000 functions, Stuxnet contains as much code as some commercial software products. The complex code is object oriented and employs many programming techniques that demonstrate advanced knowledge in many areas, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft SQL Server, Siemens software, and Siemens PLCs. The malware also employs many advanced anti-analysis techniques that make reverse engineering difficult and time consuming. ICS-CERT has identified that while USB drives appear to be a primary infection mechanism, Stuxnet can also infect systems through network shares and SQL databases. The Stuxnet malware stores dropped files in many locations on a target system. The infection mechanism is complex, and the exact files that may be dropped will vary depending on the system it is infecting. After infecting a system, the malware gathers extensive data from MS SQL server, Windows registry, and application software. Once the malware has installed itself on a system, it employs many evasive techniques, including bypassing antivirus software, advanced process injection, hooking useful functions by kernel-mode rootkits, and the quick removal of temporary files. ICS-CERT is continuing to reverse engineer and analyze this malware. Because of the malware’s complexity, this work is expected to take some time."

ICS-CERT has coordinated the issues with both Siemens and the researcher and continues to work with both entities. A portion of the reported issues involve commands being transmitted using the International Organization for Standardization Transport Service Access Point (ISO-TSAP) protocol. According to ICS-CERT analysis, the ISO-TSAP protocol is functioning to specifications; however, authentication is not performed nor are payloads encrypted or obfuscated. Like ISO-TSAP, many protocols used in industrial control systems (ICSs) were designed with interoperability in mind and were intentionally designed without security features to be as open as possible. As a result, improving ICS security may require extensive architectural changes, including the addition of built-in or layered-on techniques to enhance protocol security. Changes necessary to improve protocol security could negatively impact interoperability and performance. Some of the reported issues were coordinated and resolved with ICS-CERT and Siemens, while others were publicly released by the researcher without coordination. ICS-CERT’s Vulnerability Disclosure Policy encourages researchers to work directly with ICS-CERT and/or the affected vendor to disclose previously unknown vulnerabilities, so that patches and mitigations can be prepared and asset owners have adequate time to test and deploy them. Unless extenuating circumstances arise (e.g., active exploitation, threats of an especially serious nature, or danger to public health and safety), coordinated vulnerabilities are not publicly announced until patches/mitigations are available. The intent of this advisory is to provide a summary of the various alerts and notices as well as other public information available to date. Some ICS-CERT products related to these reports are only available on the US-CERT Portal. Asset owners and operators can request access to the US-CERT Portal by sending an e-mail message to ICS-CERT@DHS.GOV.

Additional issues reported by the researcher have also been investigated by the vendor. The vendor and researcher disagree on whether Magelis XBT HMI issue is a valid vulnerability. The Magelis XBT HMI panels have a security mode where a password is required to enable remote configuration uploads. After this mode is initially enabled, a factory default password is provided. The user is not prompted or required to supply a new password, although this capability is provided. Once the user supplies a new password, the factory default password is no longer valid. This does not fit the definition of a hard-coded password, because it can be changed. Users should be aware of the potential for configuration errors that can lead to significant security issues. The reported Resource Exhaustion issue affecting the M340 PLC family could not be duplicated by the vendor given the information supplied by the researcher. Software versions or specific configuration differences could account for the inability of the vendor to duplicate the results. In Schneider Electric’s testing on this issue, the communications module does in fact stop communicating when the connection limit is exceeded, but the PLC continues its control functions and its operation is unaffected. After the connection limit is exceeded, the communications module performs a soft reset. An attacker could not remotely exploit this observed behavior to deny PLC control functions. Although the researcher-reported behavior could not be duplicated, the vendor could not go any further with addressing it without more specific-detailed information. The remainder of this advisory addresses the two vulnerabilities that the vendor did confirm."
