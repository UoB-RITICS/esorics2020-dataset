    "icsa_oneliner": " In July, ICS-CERT published an advisory and a series of updates regarding the Stuxnet malware entitled “ICSA-10-201 USB Malware Targeting Siemens Control Software.” Since then, ICS-CERT has continued analysis of the Stuxnet malware in an effort to determine more about its capabilities and intent. As the analysis has progressed, understanding of the malware sophistication has continued to increase. Stuxnet makes use of a previously unpatched Windows vulnerability and a digitally signed kernel-mode rootkit. There have been two digital certificates used to sign this rootkit. The original certificate was revoked. Subsequently, a second variant was discovered in which the same rootkit was signed with a different key, which has also been revoked. With approximately 4,000 functions, Stuxnet contains as much code as some commercial software products. The complex code is object oriented and employs many programming techniques that demonstrate advanced knowledge in many areas, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft SQL Server, Siemens software, and Siemens PLCs. The malware also employs many advanced anti-analysis techniques that make reverse engineering difficult and time consuming. ICS-CERT has identified that while USB drives appear to be a primary infection mechanism, Stuxnet can also infect systems through network shares and SQL databases. The Stuxnet malware stores dropped files in many locations on a target system. The infection mechanism is complex, and the exact files that may be dropped will vary depending on the system it is infecting. After infecting a system, the malware gathers extensive data from MS SQL server, Windows registry, and application software. Once the malware has installed itself on a system, it employs many evasive techniques, including bypassing antivirus software, advanced process injection, hooking useful functions by kernel-mode rootkits, and the quick removal of temporary files. ICS-CERT is continuing to reverse engineer and analyze this malware. Because of the malware’s complexity, this work is expected to take some time."

The plasma clouds generated from these events have the potential to cause geomagnetic storms that can interfere with terrestrial communications and other electronic systems, posing a risk to critical infrastructure.In a recent case, Earth-orbiting satellites detected the strongest magnetic storm in more than 4 years resulting from a solar flare and CME event.a Figure 1 illustrates the size of the CME shockwave edge in relation to the size of the sun at the point of the eruption.      Figure 1. X2-solar flare and coronal mass ejection at the time of the eruption.  At 0156 UT on February 15, 2011, Active Region 11158 unleashed an X2-class eruption.b X-flares are the largest type of X-ray flares, and this is the first such eruption of new Solar Cycle 24. The explosion that produced this flare also sent a solar tsunami rippling through the sun’s atmosphere and hurled a CME toward Earth. By the time the CME reached the Earth, the shockwave leading edge had expanded to approximately 40 million miles across. CME activity will continue to occur as this solar cycle progresses. The purpose of this Advisory is to inform the industrial control systems (ICS) community of the possible impacts of solar magnetic storms on critical infrastructure control systems. This Advisory provides a high-level overview of the potential problems and offers some general mitigation strategies for consideration by the ICS community."

    "icsa_oneliner": " ICS-CERT has been coordinating multiple reports of issues affecting various models within the Siemens SIMATIC Step 7 (S7) programmable logic controller (PLC) product line. ICS-CERT has coordinated the issues with both Siemens and the researcher and continues to work with both entities. A portion of the reported issues involve commands being transmitted using the International Organization for Standardization Transport Service Access Point (ISO-TSAP) protocol. According to ICS-CERT analysis, the ISO-TSAP protocol is functioning to specifications; however, authentication is not performed nor are payloads encrypted or obfuscated. Like ISO-TSAP, many protocols used in industrial control systems (ICSs) were designed with interoperability in mind and were intentionally designed without security features to be as open as possible. As a result, improving ICS security may require extensive architectural changes, including the addition of built-in or layered-on techniques to enhance protocol security. Changes necessary to improve protocol security could negatively impact interoperability and performance. Some of the reported issues were coordinated and resolved with ICS-CERT and Siemens, while others were publicly released by the researcher without coordination. ICS-CERT’s Vulnerability Disclosure Policy encourages researchers to work directly with ICS-CERT and/or the affected vendor to disclose previously unknown vulnerabilities, so that patches and mitigations can be prepared and asset owners have adequate time to test and deploy them. Unless extenuating circumstances arise (e.g., active exploitation, threats of an especially serious nature, or danger to public health and safety), coordinated vulnerabilities are not publicly announced until patches/mitigations are available. The intent of this advisory is to provide a summary of the various alerts and notices as well as other public information available to date. Some ICS-CERT products related to these reports are only available on the US-CERT Portal. Asset owners and operators can request access to the US-CERT Portal by sending an e-mail message to ICS-CERT@DHS.GOV. Table 1 outlines the public ICS-CERT Alerts that are currently available on the ICS-CERT website. Additional ICS-CERT products are available on the US-CERT Portal. Table 1.

This alert detailed a vulnerability report of “hard-coded” credentials and improper access controls in the WAGO I/O System 758 product line. Researcher Reid Wightman of Digital Bond released these vulnerabilities without coordination with ICS-CERT or WAGO. After coordination with the researcher and the vendor, ICS-CERT determined that the improper authentication vulnerability is found in a third-party component used in multiple WAGO products. ICS-CERT is also coordinating this vulnerability with 3-S Smart Software Solutions, the third-party supplier. ICS-CERT will update an advisory with additional information from 3S as it becomes available. WAGO has confirmed that its I/O System 758 products are configured with default operating system credentials. These credentials are disclosed, but WAGO provided no information on how to change the default passwords. WAGO has released a procedure with additional documentation on how to change the default operating system passwords in Models 758-874, 758-875, and 758-876. WAGO has also released a best security practices document that makes recommendations to its customers on how to best secure its industrial control system (ICS) products. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely and proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits are known to exist."

    "icsa_oneliner": " These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely. Additional issues reported by the researcher have also been investigated by the vendor. The vendor and researcher disagree on whether Magelis XBT HMI issue is a valid vulnerability. The Magelis XBT HMI panels have a security mode where a password is required to enable remote configuration uploads. After this mode is initially enabled, a factory default password is provided. The user is not prompted or required to supply a new password, although this capability is provided. Once the user supplies a new password, the factory default password is no longer valid. This does not fit the definition of a hard-coded password, because it can be changed. Users should be aware of the potential for configuration errors that can lead to significant security issues. The reported Resource Exhaustion issue affecting the M340 PLC family could not be duplicated by the vendor given the information supplied by the researcher. Software versions or specific configuration differences could account for the inability of the vendor to duplicate the results. In Schneider Electric’s testing on this issue, the communications module does in fact stop communicating when the connection limit is exceeded, but the PLC continues its control functions and its operation is unaffected. After the connection limit is exceeded, the communications module performs a soft reset. An attacker could not remotely exploit this observed behavior to deny PLC control functions. Although the researcher-reported behavior could not be duplicated, the vendor could not go any further with addressing it without more specific-detailed information. The remainder of this advisory addresses the two vulnerabilities that the vendor did confirm."

This advisory provides additional details regarding ICS Focused Malware Havex. NCCIC/ICS-CERT is analyzing malware and artifacts associated with an industrial control system (ICS) focused malware campaign that uses multiple vectors for infection. These include phishing emails, redirections to compromised web sites and most recently, trojanized update installers on at least three ICSs vendor web sites, in what are referred to as watering-hole style attacks. Based on information ICS-CERT has obtained from Symantec and F-Secure,a the software installers for these vendors were infected with malware known as the Havex Trojan (Backdoor.Oldrea).b According to analysis, these techniques could have allowed attackers to access the networks of systems that have installed the trojanized software. Symantec describes the victims as Spain, US, France, Italy, and Germany in that order. Symantec has posted a Security Response whitepaper that details this activity and provides indicators of compromise. Symantec also ties this campaign with previous watering hole activity, namely Trojan.Karagany and the Lightsout exploit kit. The Trojan.Karagany was previously identified by Cisco as part of another watering hole attack targeting energy and oil sectors.  This malware was analyzed and detailed by ICS-CERT in Analysis Report-14-30001 Cisco Watering-Hole Malware, located within the secure portal library."

A command injection vulnerability has been reported in the Bourne again shell (bash). Bash is the common command-line used in most Linux/Unix-based operating systems and Apple’s Mac OS X. The flaw could allow an attacker to remotely execute shell commands by attaching malicious code in environment variables used by the operating system. Industrial control systems running embedded versions of Linux may not be field upgradeable are of particular concern and may require alternate mitigation. Patches have been released to fix this vulnerability by major Linux vendors for affected versions. Solutions for CVE-2014-6271 do not completely resolve the vulnerability. It is advised to install existing patches and pay attention for updated patches to address CVE-2014-7169. Exploits that target this vulnerability are publicly available. As bash is a third-party component, asset owners, operators, and SCADA product developers are encouraged to investigate the use of the affected versions of bash in their environments. ICS-CERT encourages any asset owners/operators, developers, or vendors to coordinate known implementations of the affected products directly with ICS-CERT."

FCA US LLC released a security notice and a firmware patch to owners of vehicles with the Uconnect feature on July 16, 2015. Subsequently, FCA US LLC launched two recall campaigns on July 23, 2015, and on September 5 where owners of vehicles were mailed USB sticks containing the updated software. The details of the exploit were released several weeks later at BlackHat 2015 and DefCon23 conventions held in early August in Las Vegas, Nevada. Chris Valasek and Dr. Charlie Miller confirmed a missing authorization vulnerability in FCA Uconnect RA3/RA4 radio manufactured by Harman-Kardon. FCA US LLC has produced a patch that mitigates this vulnerability and worked with Sprint, the network provider to disable access to the vulnerable port. Prior to the Blackhat conference, the researchers have tested the patch to confirm that it mitigates the vulnerability."
